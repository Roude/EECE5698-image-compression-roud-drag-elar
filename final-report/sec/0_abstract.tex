\begin{abstract}
    This report presents a modular, Python-based JPEG-like image compression system. The implementation supports a full compression and decompression pipeline, including image preprocessing, RGB-to-YCbCr color space conversion, customizable downsampling, fixed-size block division, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, entropy encoding via Huffman tables, and corresponding inverse operations. 
    
    To facilitate flexible experimentation, the system utilizes YAML-based configuration files that allow users to modify compression parameters such as quantization matrices, block size, and downsampling factors. Parameter sweeps and semantic classification tests were conducted to evaluate tradeoffs between compression efficiency, processing time, and semantic preservation. Raw image input support and modular code structure enable advanced use cases, making the framework suitable for both academic exploration and practical testing.
    
    Although inspired by the JPEG standard, the system introduces configurable elements and detailed analysis tools to better understand compression behaviors.
