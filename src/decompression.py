# This file to contain high-level functions consisting of a series of sub-routines
# defined in utilities.py

# For example:
# jpeg_decompression(compressed_file, compression_configuration)
#   load_jpeg(compressed_file)
#   perform_jpeg_decompression(compressed_image)
#   color_space_deconversion(uncompressed_image)

# Functions in this file should be composed of as few sub-routines as possible for
# readability and modularity.
