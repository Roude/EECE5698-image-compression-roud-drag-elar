chrominance_downsample_factor: 2
block_size: 8
#quality_factor: 50
# Available Chromiance quantization functions:
# Quarter Gaussian: Gaussian function from the bottom right corner of the matrix.
#   Parameters: [Max Quantization, standard deviation]
#
# LN Norm: Quantization values are the max quantization value (bottom right corner of the matrix), dividided by the
# LN norm of the distance from that matrix entry to the bottom right corner.
#   Parameters: [Max Quantization, N, distance_factor]
#
# Basic: Use default quantization tables.
